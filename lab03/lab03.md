# Prompt Engineering Process

#### Intention
>What is the improvement that you intend to make?
    The improvement that I inteded to make is that every response from the AI would be
    philosophical while answering the questions. 

#### Action/Change
>Why do you think this action/change will improve the agent?
    This improvement would provide more insight on not only the answer/response to the user input but also
    philosophy.

#### Result
>What was the result?
    The result was just as expected, but when I was entering "/exit" it wasn't working and I fixed it by making sure the last prompt was by the user.

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>Why do you think it did or did not work?
    It worked because of API calls and the type of conversation and responses was set to philosophical.
